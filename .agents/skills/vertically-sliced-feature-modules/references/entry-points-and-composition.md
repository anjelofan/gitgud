# Entry Points and Composition

Treat route, page, application, and runtime entry points as composition surfaces. They select features, provide framework context, acquire resources, and register executable capabilities.

```typescript
// BAD: a feature imports and orchestrates a peer feature.
import { showSubmissionReceipt } from '@/features/receipts';

export async function submitApplication(input: ApplicationInput) {
    const application = await persistApplication(input);
    return showSubmissionReceipt(application);
}

// GOOD: page.tsx owns cross-feature composition.
import { submitApplication } from '@/features/applications';
import { showSubmissionReceipt } from '@/features/receipts';

export async function submitFromPage(input: ApplicationInput) {
    const application = await submitApplication(input);
    return showSubmissionReceipt(application);
}
```

A feature or subsystem entry is a public composition surface for one cohesive capability. It implements or composes the complete operation its consumer needs and exports an orchestrator wrapper only when sequencing, dependency injection, resource ownership, or another real boundary requires one.

Keep setup options private when the caller only uses them to finish the operation; expose them when a framework contract or independent consumer requires them.

An entry that only re-exports implementation leaves is a barrel, not an architectural boundary; flatten a ceremonial directory when it has no public boundary or operation to own.

An internal `import "."`, module-root import, package-root import, or equivalent self-import is an architectural smell because it hides the actual dependency direction and often indicates that the entry is a barrel. Remove it. External callers import the entry; private files import the precise lower module they need.

Thin presentation routes normally render one feature entry. A caller such as `index.ts`, `mod.rs`, `__init__.py`, `__main__.py`, `page.tsx`, `+page.svelte`, or `+layout.svelte` can compose multiple isolated features when the screen or route owns the combined outcome.

Framework-owned server routes can retain authorization, request parsing, form actions, transaction coordination, and response construction when those responsibilities belong to the transport boundary.

Runtime registries and application roots can import many features. They own sequencing and dependency injection, but they must not absorb the business logic of the capabilities they register.
